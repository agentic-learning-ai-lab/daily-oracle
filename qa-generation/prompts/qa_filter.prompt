# Scoring Categories
## Correctness: Given the above article, please check if the answer is correct to the question with 100% certainty.
- 2 points: There is evidence in the article that the answer is correct with 100% certainty.
- 1 point: The answer generally aligns with the news facts but has minor inaccuracies or missing details.
- 0 point: Significantly misaligned with the news facts.

## Only Answerable on Publishing Date: Imagine traveling back in time to one week before the article's publishing date ({}). At that time, you are asked the question without having seen this specific article, but you do have access to all earlier news articles. The question should ideally be only guessable—not definitively answerable—based on the information available at that time. That is, the answer should be able to be find in the given article, but it should not be obtainable from earlier articles. Note that past tense descriptions in the article DO NOT INFLUENCE this assessment.
- 2 points: The question is answerable on {}, but only guessable not answerable before {}.
- 1 point: Could be somewhat predicted before {}, but not with complete certainty.
- 0 point: A person (could be anyone, even an expert in the field) would be able to find an article (or many) published before {} that answers the question with 100% certainty.

Example 1:
Question: What will be one of Lexi Thompson's career highlights in professional golf?
Answer: Winning 11 LPGA Tour titles.
Reasoning: This question is answerable with prior knowledge and does not test predictive ability related to the publishing date.

Reasoning: This question contains new information on the publishing date. People from the past would not have known the "NHTSA's advice".

- 2 points: The question has clear time elements, like "by May 2024" or "in July 2023".
- 1 point: The question includes a general timeframe, like "next month" or "this winter," which allows for some estimation but lacks precise dates.
- 0 point: The question includes vague time phrases like "in the future" or "in the upcoming weeks," which do not specify a clear or precise timeframe.

### 0 point examples
Example 1:

- 2 points: The question covers a topic that widely affects or interests the public.
- 1 point: The question is of moderate interest, relevant to specific groups.

- 1 point: The answer is somewhat predictable but includes minor additional information or a slight twist.
- 0 point: The answer directly restates or closely mirrors the question, offering no new details or insights.
